Paypal Cashout method
basically if your account gets limited for whatever reason PayPal will probably lock a few actions like ; Sending money , receiving money etc etc but what they don't lock is "Refunding Customers/People".
We can use this to our advantage.

Once your account gets locked you will go through your transactions until you find a transaction from a trusted person then you go ahead and DM/call that person and tell him that you will refund him money on PayPal and if he could send it to you in a different way ; Crypto , Bank , Giftcards whatever.

Repeat this process for multiple transactions until you got no money left in your PayPal account. All your money will have been saved.

Sidenote : if you get the 180 days lock you won't be able to log in to your account and therefore won't be able to refund any transactions. The amount on the transaction that you are refunded can be lowered but can not be higher so example ;

You have a â‚¬400 transaction and you only have â‚¬200 left in your PayPal account you can change this to â‚¬200 so your refund can go through without any problems .
Enjoy!
